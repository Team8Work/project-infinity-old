# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline set up for Project Infinity.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and streamlining the release process. It is implemented using GitHub Actions.

## Pipeline Workflow

### Triggers

The pipeline is triggered on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branches

### Jobs and Steps

#### Build and Test

1. **Checkout Code**: Retrieves the latest code from the repository
2. **Setup Node.js**: Configures Node.js environment (v18)
3. **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
4. **Type Checking**: Runs `npm run check` to verify TypeScript types
5. **Build Application**: Runs `npm run build` to create production build
6. **Upload Artifacts**: Stores build artifacts for potential deployment

## Local Development Setup

A Docker Compose configuration is provided to ensure consistent development environments:

```bash
# Start the database container
docker-compose up -d

# Run the application in development mode
npm run dev
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add automated testing step when tests are implemented
- Configure deployment to cloud provider (AWS/Azure)
- Add environment-specific configurations
- Implement database migration steps

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified in package.json
3. Ensure Docker is properly configured if using containerized builds
